# LibSciPute

My Sci(entific) (Com)puting library is written in C.

[Documentation](doc/TOC.md)

To compile the library and run the tests, run `make` in the root directory.
To just build the library, run `make build`.
To run just the tests after compilation run `make tests`.
To install the library on your system run `sudo make install`.
To clean up the compilation, run `make clean`.

This has only been tested on a linux system.
